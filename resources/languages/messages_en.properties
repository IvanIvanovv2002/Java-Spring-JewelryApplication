RingMeasureFind = How do I determine my ring size ?
RingMeasurerWays = Determining a ring size can be done in several ways:
FirstWay = 1. You visit a jewelry store, and they measure your size there.
SecondWay = 2. You take a ring that fits you well on the finger for which you want the ring, put it on the table and with a ruler measure the inner diameter as accurately as possible. For this measurement, it is good to use a caliper if you have it available. (see figure 1)
ThirdWay = 3. Another type of measurement is done by using a thread that you tie around the desired finger and then cut precisely. You untie the thread from your finger and stretch it on a centimeter or ruler, measuring its length. A similar technique is also known as applying a paper tape around the finger. With the help of a pencil or pen, we mark where the tape ends around the full circumference of the finger and again measure the resulting unfolded length. It is very important to know that the sizes of the fingers of the left and right hands are quite different, especially the ring fingers.
RingMeasureMoreInfo = The first way is the most accurate, the second way is with a permissible difference, the third way is with the greatest possibility of wrong size.
RingMeasureMoreInfo2 = We attach fig. 2 with a table of sizes in different countries compared with internal diameter.
